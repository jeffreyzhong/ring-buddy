## 4. Business Mission and Details

- **Mission:** At Halo Spa, the mission is to offer tailored treatments crafted specifically for each individual. There is a heavy emphasis on "nurturing the scalp" and "enhancing the health and vitality of the hair" as the foundation for overall beauty.

- **Philosophy:** The spa focuses on a "head-to-toe" renewal philosophy.
